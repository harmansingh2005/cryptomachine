# üîê CryptoMachine

**CryptoMachine** is a simple yet effective file encryption and decryption GUI tool built with Python and Tkinter. It allows you to securely encrypt any file using AES encryption with a user-defined secret key, and decrypt it later using the same key.

## Features

- AES-256 encryption using password-derived keys
- GUI-based interface with `tkinter`
- Encrypt **any file** on your computer
- Decrypt using the same secret key
- Real-time progress feedback
- Cancel encryption/decryption mid-process
- Simple, beginner-friendly, and open-source

## How To Use?
- Open the app and click SELECT FILE to pick the file you want to encrypt or decrypt.
- Enter a Secret Key. (Remember it! You‚Äôll need it to decrypt.)
- Click ENCRYPT to encrypt the selected file. A .kryp file will be created.
- To decrypt, select a .kryp file, enter the original secret key, and click DECRYPT.
- Click RESET to clear all input fields.
- Click CANCEL anytime during processing to abort.
    - üìù Encrypted files will look like: myphoto.jpg.kryp
    - üìù Decrypted files will be saved as: myphoto__dekrypted__.jpg

## Security Notes

- Uses AES in CFB mode (no padding required).
- Secret key and salt are hashed with SHA256 to derive strong 256-bit and 128-bit keys.
- The secret key is never stored or transmitted ‚Äî decryption is only possible if the correct key is provided.
- If the secret key is lost, there is no recovery for encrypted files.

## Future Improvements

- Add drag-and-drop file support
- Mask password field input
- Support batch file encryption
- Show estimated time remaining
- Portable .exe/.app builds for all platforms
- Add command-line interface (CLI) mode
